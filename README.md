# auditSign 📝
Smart Contracts that allow the signing of IPFS hashes, used to sign our audit reports. To ensure that people know what they are signing, the signature is presented to the user in cleartext, hence the verification is a bit different, but basically the same.

## Deployed Instances
We will deploy these contracts onto the Ethereum Mainnet as well as to the xDai chain and MATIC. If any of our clients wish to have these contracts on different networks, please let us know.

## How to use
* Clone the repository
* `npm install` to get the depenedencies ready
* `truffle compile`
